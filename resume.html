			<h2>Showcasing Your Skills and Experiences</h2>
			<img src="images/UMSI_working.jpg" alt="A student in a Michigan branded shirt and hat works on their laptop">
			<p>
			Beyond listing your job titles and responsibilities, your resume should highlight
			the unique skills and experiences that set you apart. Think about the tools,
			technologies, and methods you’ve learned at UMSI and how they apply to real-world
			problems. Employers want to see not only what you’ve done, but also how you think
			and contribute.
			</p>

			<h3>Ideas for What to Include</h3>
			<ul class="grid-area">
				<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Programming languages, data analysis tools, design software, or UX research methods you’ve mastered.</li>
				<li><strong>Projects:</strong> Capstone, client, or class projects that demonstrate collaboration, leadership, or problem-solving.</li>
				<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Volunteer work, student organizations, or leadership experiences that show initiative and impact.</li>
				<li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Scholarships, awards, or recognition from faculty, peers, or employers.</li>
			</ul>
